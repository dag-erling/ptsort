# Building and installing ptsort

## Prerequisites

This software should build and run on any reasonably modern POSIX-like
system including BSD, macOS, and most Linux distributions, requiring
only a POSIX-compatible Make and a C compiler.

If you checked out the source code directly from the repository, you
will also need GNU autoconf and automake.

## Generating the configure script

If you downloaded a release tarball, you can skip this step, as the
configure script has been pregenerated for your convenience.

If you checked out the source code directly from the repository, you
will need to generate the configure script before you can run it.
Simply run the provided script:

    $ ./autogen.sh

## Configuring

Run the configure script to generate an appropriate `lib/config.h` for
your system, optionally specifying an alternate installation prefix:

    $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME

## Building

To build, simply make the default target:

    $ make

## Running the tests

To run the provided tests, make the `check` target:

    $ make check

## Installing

To install, make the `install` target, optionally specifying an
alternate prefix:

    $ make install prefix=$HOME

Note that you do not need to specify the prefix here if you already
did so when running the configure script.
